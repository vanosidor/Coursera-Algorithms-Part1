## Percolation
Finds the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
The percolation threshold is the probability needed for a cell to be open to almost guarantee that a system percolates. A system percolates if there is a connection between the top and bottom of the system.

## Deque and Randomized Queues
Implementation of a generic double-ended queue and randomized queue (using arrays and linked list of Node objects)

## Pattern Recognition
Given a set of `n` points, outputs all distinct maximal line segments containing at least four collinear points. There are two implementations: 1) brute force and 2) merge sort with O(nlogn) time complexety
